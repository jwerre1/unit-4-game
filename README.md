Unit 4 Game: Crystal Collector

As the instructions state on the webpage, the point of the game is to match a target score by selecting crystals of different point values. These point values are randomly assigned between 1-12, and change with each round. 

The game keeps track of how many times you've won and lost, as well as how lony any current win streak is. Each time you win or lose, a prompt appears.

The game is made using jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap. Fonts derive from Google Fonts.
